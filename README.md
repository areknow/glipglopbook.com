# Glip Glop: The Book Drop

www.glipglopbook.com

## Overview

### What is Glip Glop?

Glip Glip is a book for college students to use to trade away their unused books for credits towards new book. These books can be text books, novels, or collector's items. 

### How it Works

Glip Glop specializes in being a no fee site that users can use to trade books between each other for points that can be used to purchase different books. In short, a user can list a book that they want to trade away with a price that they are looking to get for the item. When another user wants this book, they either can accept the listed price, or propose a new price to the owner. Once the price is agreed upon, the points are subtracted from the buyer's account. The next step is for the original owner to send the book to its new owner. Once the book is received in the mail, points are added to the sender's account.

### Why Glip Glop?

Glip Glop takes the idea of an almost perfect trading scenario and applies it to books. In this scenario, a user can find a book that they want, and save up points to get that book by sending out their old unused books to other users or purchasing points from the website. Once they have enough points to get the book that they need, the can initiate the trade. In most cases, a sender won't want five less valuable books and a few bucks for their expensive book. But with Glip Glop, you can send the five books to other users and still get the book that you need.

## Technical Stuff

### Glip Glop Currency
The currency that Glip Glop uses is simply refered to as "points." The point to USD conversion is 1 point to $0.01 USD. These points can be purchased from the Glip Glop website or from other users. Users can set their own point-to-USD conversion rate. These transactions will be securely processed using PayPal.

### Trade Sequence Breakdown
The following is the breakdown of steps that a trade consists of:

1. The user adds a book to the website, sets an asking price for the book, and the condition of the book with a description.
2. Another user can accept the asking price or propose an offer.
3. The seller can either reject or accept the proposed offer.
4. If the offer is rejected, the buyer is notified of the denial.
5. If the offer is accepted, the trade is initiated.
6. Points are deducted from the buyer's account.
6. If the seller goes to the same University or a nearby University, the trading partners can set up a meeting to meet on campus to complete the trade.
7. If the seller is not near the buyer, the book is mailed to the buyer using USPS's discounted "Media Mail" service.
8. Once the book is received, the buyer assesses the condition.
9. If the condition is as stated, the buyer completes the trade and points are added to the seller's account.
10. If the condition does not match the seller's description, the buyer can open a case for the trade.
11. If a case is opened, the traders can work out a discount or the buyer can demand a refund and mail the book back.
